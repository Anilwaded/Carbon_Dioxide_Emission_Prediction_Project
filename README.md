# Carbon Dioxide Emission Prediction
## Introduction:
#### Global warming is one of the biggest challenges currently being faced by the human race, although correlation is not causation a likely cause of global warming is due to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide from human activities.

#### The Project Carbon Dioxide Emission Prediction based on features of Engines is an innovative approach to predicting carbon dioxide emissions from vehicles based on engine features. As the world continues to grapple with the challenges posed by climate change, the transportation sector has come under increasing scrutiny for its significant contribution to greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide.

#### This project aims to provide a more accurate and efficient way to estimate carbon dioxide emissions from vehicles, which can help governments, businesses, and individuals make more informed decisions about their transportation choices. By analyzing various engine features such as displacement, power, and fuel type, the project can predict carbon dioxide emissions with a high degree of accuracy.

#### Passenger cars produced approximately three billion metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions worldwide in 2020. The emissions produced by passenger cars have been steadily rising over the past two decades, increasing from 2.2 billion metric tons in 2000 to a peak of 3.2 million metric tons. Emissions fell roughly six percent in a 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused major disruptions to transportation.

#### Overall, the Project Carbon Dioxide Emission Prediction based on features of Engines has the potential to make a significant contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector and promoting a more sustainable future for all.

## Deliverables:
#### The benefits of this project are significant. Firstly, it will help individuals and businesses make informed decisions when purchasing vehicles, by providing a clearer understanding of the carbon footprint associated with different engine types. Secondly, it will assist policymakers in developing more effective regulations and incentives aimed at reducing carbon emissions from the transportation sector.

#### Furthermore, this project can also be helpful for the automobile industry in a number of ways. It can assist manufacturers in developing more fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly engines, which can increase their market share and competitiveness. Additionally, it can help companies comply with increasingly stringent emissions regulations, thereby avoiding penalties and reputational damage.

## Objective:
#### The goal of this project is to predict CO2 emissions in g/km produced by any vehicle based on several car engine features.

## About Dataset:
### Content
#### This dataset captures the details of how CO2 emissions by a vehicle can vary with the different features. The dataset has been taken from Canada Government official open data website. This is a compiled version. This contains data over a period of 7 years.
#### There are total 7385 rows and 12 columns. There are few abbreviations that has been used to describe the features. I am listing them out here. The same can be found in the Data Description sheet.
